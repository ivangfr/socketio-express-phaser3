# socketio-express-phaser3

The goal of this project is to implement a multiplayer game using [`Socket.IO`](https://socket.io/), [`ExpressJS`](https://expressjs.com/) and [`Phaser 3`](https://phaser.io/phaser3).

## Prerequisites

- [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/), in case you want to expose the game, running on your local machine, to the internet
